# Primes
Prime Number Research 

The current research approach is the following:
1) Take the prime number list
2) Subtract one from each prime number, turning it even.
3) The even numbers that orginated from prime numbers from steps 1 and 2 can then be added together to form new prime numbers, with the addition of 1 back.  E1 + E2 = New Even Prime.  Prime = New Even Prime + 1; The theory here is that the prime numbers are not random and form like molecules in a chemical reaction or protons and electrons in an atom.  It appears possible to create all primes from pre-existing prime numbers this way.  What is interesting with this approach is that the creation of the primes is not sequential in nature.
